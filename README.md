Defining basic TypeScript types
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with the fundamental concepts of TypeScript, including variable declarations, data types, and basic syntax.

Problem Statement: As a budding developer, understanding the basics of TypeScript is crucial. In this assignment, you will delve into variable declarations, explore various data types, and practice writing TypeScript code snippets.

Task 1: Declare a variable named greeting with the data type string and assign it the value "Hello, TypeScript!"

Task 2: Create a variable named numberList with the data type number[] and initialize it with an array of three numbers: 5, 10, and 15.

Task 3: Define a function named calculateSum that takes two parameters (a and b) of type number and returns their sum.

Task 4: Render the previous types to the screen in a Typescript Component.

Expected Outcomes:

After completing task 1, students should be able to declare variables with specific data types,
After completing task 2, students should be able to initialize arrays using specific data types
After completing task 3, students should be able to create functions with parameterized types in TypeScript.
Array Manipulation and Data Rendering
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce understanding of TypeScript in React, focusing on array manipulation and rendering typed data to the screen.

Problem Statement: In this assignment, you will explore the power of TypeScript in handling arrays and rendering data dynamically in React components. The tasks involve common array manipulation operations and displaying the results on the screen.  Make sure you appropriately type all variables and parameters.

Task 1: Create a React component named ColorList that renders a predefined TypeScript array of colors (strings) directly within the component. Display each color as a list item.

Task 2: Implement a TypeScript function named filterNumbers that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only even numbers. Develop a React component named EvenNumbers that uses the filterNumbers function and renders the resulting even numbers directly within the component.

Task 3: Create a React component named UserList that directly renders a predefined array of user objects (each with name and age properties). The UserList should utilize a User Type Alias or Interface.

Expected Outcomes:

After completing Task 1, students should demonstrate the ability to declare variables with specific data types within a React component.
After completing Task 2, students should showcase the skill to initialize arrays and manipulate them using specific data types directly within a React component. Students should exhibit the capability to create functions with parameterized types in TypeScript, enhancing their understanding of function-based array manipulations.
After completing Task 3, students should master the art of directly rendering predefined data structures, fostering a deeper comprehension of handling complex data within React components without relying on the prop system.
